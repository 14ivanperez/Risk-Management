- Random Distribution
- Empirical Distribution
- Student T Distribution

### Simulations used to estimate  VaR and ES at 10-day horizon

- Simulation 1: the scaled student-t distribution
- Simulation 2: randomly samples ten 1-day observations from the empirical distribution and add them up
- Simulation 3: randomly draws blocks of ten consecutive 1-day outcomes and add them up
